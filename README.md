# Number_Guessing_Game
A fun number guessing game built with JavaScript. Guess the random number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts!


# Key concepts and technologies used in this project:

HTML5: Structure of the game page, forms, and user input.



CSS: Styling of the game interface (you may want to elaborate on your styling file in the styles.css).



JavaScript:
DOM Manipulation: Interact with HTML elements to display guesses, results, and update game states dynamically.
Random Number Generation: Use of Math.random() to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
Event Handling: Listening for user interactions (click events on the submit button, form submission, and restarting the game).
Game Logic: Validating user input, checking if the guess matches the random number, and providing feedback.
